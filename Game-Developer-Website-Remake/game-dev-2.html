            <h2>Career Growth and Opportunities</h2>
            <p>Game developers get raises that are quite significant as they gain more experience working for a company. Video game developers can have their salary grow by 15 percent within five to nine years of experience. Typically, the longer a game developer is working, the larger the salary growth per year they will receive as they gain more and more experience. As a beginner video game developer, a worker will work with veteran game developers and complete work that is given to them by their more experienced coworkers. As a developer completes more games and experiences the complete game development cycle a few times, they might have the opportunity to become a more senior member of the development team and get to work on more important parts of the game or assign work to developers junior to themselves. As video games become more and more popular, the demand for video game developers also rises, making the path of a game developer a great career path to ensure that your skills are needed for a long time into the future. </p>
