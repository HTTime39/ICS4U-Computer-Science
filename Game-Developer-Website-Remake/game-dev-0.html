                <h2>What Does a Game Developer Do?</h2>
                <p>A video game developer is the person at a game company that will write the code for the video game they are making. They will write games for the PC, video game consoles, and mobile devices. They will write the code needed for games to work. For example, they will program the different systems and mechanics that will work to complete the tasks required by the game company's design team. They will also help to program the way that the different models and art created by the game company's art team will interact with each other and the environment they exist in so that the game works and can be played. In summary, a video game developer is essentially the person that makes everything in a game come to life.</p>

                <h2>Game Developer History</h2>
                <p>Game development began in the 1960s, but the games that were developed were not publicly distributed because the general public didn't really have computers to run the games yet. When game consoles and personal computers became more widespread in households, more game developers were needed because more games needed to be made for people to play on their computers and consoles. As computer hardware has increased in performance, games are able to be more and more complex, making the demand for game developers increase as well, because companies need more developers to help design these complex systems in reasonable amounts of time. </p>
